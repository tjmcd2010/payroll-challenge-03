# Payroll Challenge

## User Story

AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data

## Steps taken to complete the project

1. I studied the provided images and gif to find the intended result
2. I reviewed the mini project and started off by creatiing the entermoredata variable
3. I used the same concepts in the rock paper scissors project to create the window prompts
4. I added an isNAN function to ensure that a number was entered for salary, or it defaulted to 0 if no data was entered
5. I added syntax to capitalize the first letter of the first and last name if they were entered in any other format. 
6. I updated the console log entries to match the one in the initial mock-up
7. I took a screenshot and screen recordings of the finished work.
